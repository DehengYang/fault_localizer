    [debugging fl of APR_Bugs.jar_Accumulo_df4b1985] the fl paused at the very beginning, I don't why. I debugged for a day? (roughly) And even created Nopol-FL-module in my framework. Finally I find it is caused by the sh command: timeout 180min java. I don't know why... This is is just really hard to find and understand...

## New version 

I will further develop new version(s) based on the present version mentioned above.
